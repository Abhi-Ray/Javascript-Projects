            reserves the right to change its Fee Policy from time to time. In
            particular, Blue Pen may at its sole discretion introduce new
            services and modify some or all of the existing services offered on
            the Website. In such an event Blue Pen reserves the right to
            introduce fees for the new services offered or amend/introduce fees
            for existing services, as the case may be. Changes to the fee policy

            Unless otherwise stated, all fees shall be quoted in Indian Rupees.
            You shall be solely responsible for compliance of all applicable

            transactions or stolen cards will immediately be reported to the law
            authorities. We will not be held liable for the consequences of an

            refund will be paid to the client after complete evaluation of the
            situation from all aspects. However this facility doesn’t apply if
            the delay is due to factors from the client’s side. All documents
            will be delivered via email so accurate and up to the date
            information must be provided. <br />
            <br />
            <b> FREE ASSIGNMENT REVISION POLICY</b> <br />If a client isn’t
            pleased with the received document he/she can avail the startling
            offer of free revisions. This actually befalls seldom however even
            when it does the client becomes gratified after only one or maximum
            two revisions. The free revision policy remains effective for a
            spell of 10-15 business days reliant on the length of the document.
            A trifling fee is vital for every revision later. <br /><br />
            <b> REFUND/ CANCELLATION STRATEGY </b> <br />Cancellation should be
            done before the transaction processing starts. Once the order is
            assigned to the writer and advance payment is made the order cannot
            be cancelled then. Also the charges of transaction placement are non
            refundable. <br />
            The company reserves the authority of refund and cancellation appeal
            approval or denial. <br /><br />
            <b> TRANSACTION VERIFICATION PERIOD</b> <br />We have set a
            verification period for the clients to submit their billing
            information for the order to start getting processed. This time
            frame is reliant on the type and length of the document.<br />
            Verification period of 8 hours for a 2-20 days delivery<br />
            Verification period of 2 hours for a 12-24 hours delivery<br />
            Verification period of 30 minutes for a 12 hours delivery
            <br /><br />
            <b> TRANSACTION DEFERRALS </b> <br />An order delivery is deferred
            due to the below mentioned reasons: <br />Delayed payments: If the
            billing information is not verified on time <br />Incorrect
            information: If the client wishes to make amendments in the
            document. If the client shows carelessness in checking the messages
            from the writer on time then those charges will not be repaid.
